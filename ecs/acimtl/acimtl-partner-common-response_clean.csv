"DOC-001: Architecture Diagram with Scalability and High Availability","The ACI-MTL platform architecture is designed with scalability and high availability using AWS Fargate, Application Load Balancer, and multi-AZ deployment across multiple AWS services.

Evidence

Architecture Diagram: See included diagram - Complete cloud architecture showing VPC with public/private subnets, Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Fargate services (API and web server) in private subnets, RDS database, and external AWS services (S3, Cognito, IAM).

Failure Recovery: Major solution elements maintain availability through multi-AZ RDS deployment with automated backups, ECS service auto-restart for failed tasks, Elastic Load Balancer health checks with automatic traffic routing, and S3 cross-region replication for document storage.

Automatic Scaling: ECS Fargate services scale automatically based on CPU/memory utilization, RDS provides automated storage scaling, and Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple availability zones as demand changes."

Wildcard Avoidance: Specific denial policies prevent broad permission grants and enforce granular access controls
Individual Accountability: Every team member uses dedicated credentials through Google Workspace integration with unique @ingeno.ca accounts
Service Control Policies: Organizational controls prevent local IAM user creation and enforce centralized identity management
Access Architecture: Standardized permission set mapping across organizational units with quarterly access reviews

Compliance Controls:
No permanent access keys distributed or stored across any customer environments
Universal MFA enforcement with Google Authenticator integration and no bypass capabilities
CloudTrail logging across all regions providing complete audit trail for all access activities
Centralized identity management through AWS IAM Identity Center eliminating local account creation

"OPE-003: Use Consistent Processes to Assess Deployment Readiness","Ingeno employs a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that ensures deployment readiness through comprehensive testing and validation processes. Rather than manual checklists, our approach leverages an automated checklist with automated testing, peer review, and staged deployment processes to guarantee code quality and system reliability before production deployment.

Evidence

Automated CI/CD Pipeline Process:

Our deployment readiness assessment includes:
Automated Code Quality: Linting, security scanning, and code quality checks executed on every commit
Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing automatically executed in CI pipeline
Peer Review Process: All code changes require GitHub pull request approval from senior developers before merge
Staged Deployment: Code deployed first to testing environment (production replica) for validation
Zero-Downtime Production Deployment: ECS rolling deployments with health checks ensure seamless production updates
Automated Rollback: Pipeline automatically reverts deployments if health checks or monitoring thresholds indicate issues

This automated approach eliminates manual checklist errors while ensuring consistent, reliable deployments across all customer environments."
"NETSEC-001: Define Security Best Practices for Virtual Private Cloud and Network Security","Ingeno implements comprehensive VPC network security using standardized AWS CDK infrastructure that enforces defense-in-depth architecture with multi-tier network segmentation, granular security group controls, and AWS native security services integration.

Evidence

Ingeno has developed reusable CDK constructs to implement network security best practices in a reliable and repeatable way. 

VPC Construct

A two-tier VPC construct implements a two-tier architecture with the following key features:

Network Configuration:
Creates public subnets for internet-facing resources
Creates private subnets with egress (for resources that need outbound internet but no inbound)
Spans exactly multiple availability zones for high availability
NAT Gateway Strategy:
Production mode (prod: true): Creates one NAT gateway per AZ (2 total) for high availability
Non-production mode: Creates only 1 NAT gateway to save costs
VPC Flow Logs:
Automatically configures VPC flow logs to capture rejected traffic
Creates a dedicated CloudWatch log group with infinite retention
Sets up proper IAM roles and policies for flow log delivery
Network ACLs: Using default NACL configuration (allows all traffic) - security controls implemented primarily through security group rules

This construct is designed to provide a cost-effective, secure, and highly available network foundation that can be easily reused across different AWS stacks and environments.

Security Groups Constructs

Security groups are used to control traffic flow between subnets and to the internet and between relevant AWS resources. We have reusable constructs to implement security groups for the interoperability between ECS services and database resources:

Database is deployed in private subnets
ECS services are deployed in private subnets
ECS services can access database using security group rules
Database can not be accessed from the internet
ECS services can access the internet using NAT gateway
A bastion host is deployed in public subnets to access private subnets 
Developers can connect to the bastion host using session manager to access private subnets
SSH tunneling is used between the bastion and database to troubleshoot database issues or to perform database maintenance"
"NETSEC-002: Define Data Encryption Policy for Data at Rest and in Transit","Ingeno enforces comprehensive data encryption for all customer environments using AWS native encryption services and industry-standard protocols. Our standardized encryption policy ensures all data is protected both at rest and in transit with centralized key management through AWS KMS.

Evidence

Internet-Facing Endpoints Encryption: 
Public endpoints (Load balancers for UI and API) use HTTPS
AWS Certificate Manager provides SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS listeners
Automatic redirection ensures all traffic uses encrypted connections

External API Communication Encryption:
All external API calls use HTTPS/TLS (mainly to invoke other AWS services)
AWS SDK Encryption: All AWS service communications automatically encrypted in transit
Certificate Validation: Enforced certificate validation for all outbound connections

Data at Rest Encryption:
RDS Database: PostgreSQL database encrypted at rest using customer-managed KMS key (e.g. for production : arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:628892762446:key/95c863e4-8572-4e22-a4eb-0a559f25db34) 
CloudWatch Logs: Application logs and VPC flow logs encrypted using KMS keys
ECS Fargate: Container runtime and ephemeral storage encrypted using AWS Fargate platform encryption

Key Management Implementation:
AWS KMS Integration: Centralized key management with customer-managed keys for production databases
Key Rotation: Automatic annual rotation for AWS managed keys, scheduled rotation for customer-managed keys
Access Control: KMS key policies restrict access to authorized IAM roles and services only
Audit Logging: All key usage tracked through CloudTrail for security compliance"
