I need to make sure my project acimtl respects AWS Service Delivery as defined in @ecs-service-validation.md 

You can find information about my project in @acimtl.md 

You can find an architecture diagram in @acimtl-diagram.mmd 

I have started to build a document to respond to each requirement in @acimtl-partner-response.md 

If you have any questions, please let me know. NEVER fabricate information or evidence. 

If you need add AWS CLI commands outputs as evidence, always make sure to run the actual commands to ensure they do what you think.
