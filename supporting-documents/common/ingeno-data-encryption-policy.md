# Ingeno Data Encryption and Key Management Policy

## Purpose

This document defines Ingeno's comprehensive data encryption policy for data at rest and in transit across all customer AWS environments. The policy ensures that all sensitive data is protected using industry-standard encryption practices and AWS native encryption services with centralized key management.

## Scope

This policy covers:
- Encryption of data at rest for all AWS storage services
- Encryption of data in transit for all network communications
- Cryptographic key management and storage practices
- Internet-facing endpoints encryption requirements
- External API communication encryption standards

- ECS task definition storage encrypted using AWS Fargate platform encryption
- Application logs encrypted at rest in CloudWatch Logs
- Container image storage encrypted in Amazon ECR using AES-256

**Amazon DynamoDB:**
- Encryption at rest enabled by default for all DynamoDB tables

**Amazon S3:**
- Server-side encryption enabled by default for all S3 buckets

- Bucket policies enforce encrypted uploads only

**Amazon CloudWatch Logs:**
- Log groups encrypted using AWS KMS keys
- Application logs and VPC flow logs encrypted at rest
- Retention policies enforced with encrypted storage

### Encryption Configuration Requirements

**Infrastructure as Code Implementation:**
- All encryption settings defined in AWS CDK constructs
- No unencrypted storage services deployed in any environment
- Encryption keys and policies version controlled with infrastructure code

**Key Rotation:**
- AWS managed keys automatically rotated annually
- Customer managed keys rotation schedule based on data sensitivity
- Key rotation monitored and alerted through CloudWatch

## Data Encryption in Transit

### Internet-Facing Endpoints

**Application Load Balancer HTTPS:**
- All public-facing endpoints require HTTPS/TLS 1.2 or higher
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect enforced at load balancer level
- SSL/TLS certificates managed through AWS Certificate Manager
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled for all HTTPS connections

**API Gateway (when used):**
- TLS 1.2 minimum encryption for all API endpoints
- Custom domain certificates managed through AWS Certificate Manager
- API keys and authentication tokens transmitted over encrypted connections only

**CDN/CloudFront Distribution:**
- HTTPS required for all content delivery
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect policy enforced
- TLS 1.2 minimum protocol version
- Custom SSL certificates for custom domains

### Internal Service Communication

**ECS Service to RDS:**
- Database connections encrypted using SSL/TLS
- PostgreSQL: `sslmode=require` enforced in connection strings
- RDS force SSL parameter enabled for all database instances

**ECS Service to DynamoDB:**
- All DynamoDB API calls encrypted in transit using HTTPS
- AWS SDK automatically uses TLS 1.2 for all communications
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) connections encrypted when used

**ECS Service to External APIs:**
- All external API calls use HTTPS/TLS 1.2 or higher
- Certificate validation enforced for all outbound connections
- No plaintext HTTP allowed for external communications

**Lambda to AWS Services:**
- All AWS SDK calls automatically encrypted in transit
- VPC endpoints use TLS encryption for AWS service communication
- Environment variables containing secrets encrypted using KMS

### VPC Internal Traffic

**Service-to-Service Communication:**
- Internal load balancer traffic encrypted when sensitive data transmitted
- Microservice authentication tokens encrypted in transit
- Database replication traffic encrypted using native service encryption

## Key Management

### AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

**Customer Managed Keys:**
- Dedicated customer managed KMS keys for highly sensitive data
- Key policies restrict access to authorized IAM roles and services only
- CloudTrail logging enabled for all key usage and management operations

**Key Usage Policies:**
- Separate keys per environment (production, staging, development)
- Separate keys per data classification level (public, internal, confidential)
- Cross-account key access restricted and audited

**Key Administration:**
- Key administrators separated from key users
- Multi-person approval required for key deletion
- Key usage monitoring through CloudWatch metrics and alarms

### Secrets Management

**AWS Secrets Manager:**
- Database credentials stored and rotated automatically
- Application secrets encrypted using dedicated KMS keys
- Secret access logged and monitored through CloudTrail

**AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:**
- Configuration parameters encrypted using KMS keys
- SecureString parameter type enforced for sensitive configuration
- Parameter access controlled through IAM policies

### Certificate Management

**AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):**
- All SSL/TLS certificates provisioned and managed through ACM
- Automatic certificate renewal for AWS-managed certificates
- Certificate expiration monitoring and alerting

**Custom Certificate Requirements:**
- Minimum 2048-bit RSA or 256-bit ECC keys
- SHA-256 signature algorithm minimum
- Certificate transparency logging enabled

---

## Implementation Standards

### Infrastructure as Code

**CDK Encryption Patterns:**
- All storage services configured with encryption by default
- KMS key resources defined in CDK with appropriate policies
- Encryption validation included in CI/CD pipeline checks

**Environment Configuration:**
- Production environments use customer managed KMS keys
- Non-production environments may use AWS managed keys for cost optimization
- Encryption settings consistently applied across all environments

### Monitoring and Compliance

**Encryption Compliance Monitoring:**
- AWS Config rules monitor encryption compliance across all services
- CloudWatch alarms for encryption policy violations
- Regular compliance scanning and reporting

**Access Logging:**
- All key usage logged through CloudTrail
- Secret access patterns monitored and analyzed
- Anomalous encryption/decryption activity alerting

### Data Classification

**Data Sensitivity Levels:**
- **Public:** AWS managed encryption acceptable
- **Internal:** Customer managed keys recommended
- **Confidential:** Customer managed keys with restricted access required
- **Restricted:** Dedicated keys with enhanced monitoring and controls

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Alignment

**Industry Standards:**
- AES-256 encryption algorithm minimum for data at rest
- TLS 1.2 minimum for data in transit
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs for key storage (AWS KMS)

**Audit Requirements:**
- Annual encryption policy review and update
- Quarterly key access pattern analysis
- Regular penetration testing of encrypted communications

### Data Residency

**Regional Compliance:**
- Encryption keys stored in same region as encrypted data
- Cross-region key replication for disaster recovery when required
- Regional compliance requirements met for data sovereignty

## Incident Response

### Encryption Failures

**Key Compromise Response:**
1. Immediate key rotation for affected keys
2. Re-encryption of affected data with new keys
3. Access pattern analysis for unauthorized usage
4. Incident documentation and lessons learned

**Certificate Expiration:**
1. Automated monitoring and alerting for certificate expiration
2. Emergency certificate issuance procedures
3. Service recovery procedures for expired certificates

### Security Breach Protocol

**Data Exposure Response:**
1. Immediate assessment of encryption status for exposed data
2. Enhanced monitoring of related encryption keys
3. Customer notification if encrypted data potentially compromised
4. Forensic analysis of encryption logs and access patterns
